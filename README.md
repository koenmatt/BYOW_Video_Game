A video game I made for UC Berkeley's CS61B - Data Structures and Algorithms. It is primarily written in Java and made me quite fond of the often hated language. 

It is a randomly generated world game. You play as a snake exploring, eating, fighting, opening chests etc. 

I drew and designed all pixel art using ProCreate on an iPad, and programmed the entire project myself. 

This project recieved the highest grade in the class that semester.
